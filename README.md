# IM-LY

An AI that generates Images and NFTs from plain text.

About IM-LY
It harnesses the power of AI for imagining user's input.

It uses Deep Learning Tech along with Blockchain to get the best out of both worlds, AI and Web 3.0.

Why?
Existing solutions aren't free to use or the free alternatives are too slow, can't run on potato PCs or fail to understand the context/intent of the user's prompt.

IM-LY being open source, is free to use, resource friendly, and generates NFTs directly from the generated images, making it something different!

For example
INPUT:

Dog swimming in water, photorealistic
